# NDK Svelte Component Library

The goal of these components is to make it as easy as possible to develop Nostr apps using NDK and Svelte. Think of the components detailed in this Storybook as unstyled legos that you can use to build your Nostr apps without having to think about fetching data for common patterns.

## Use the components in your app

First, install the library using: `npm install @nostr-dev-kit/ndk-svelte-components`

Then, simply import any of the components that you want to use: `import { Avatar, Name } from '@nostr-dev-kit/ndk-svelte-components'`

### Styling components

You can pass `style` or `class` attributes on any component to pass those through to the outermost `HTMLElement` rendered in a component. This allows you to style directly or to use a framework like [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/).
